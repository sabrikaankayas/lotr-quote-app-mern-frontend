Lord Denethor however, is not the King. He is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne.","Now listen carefully. Lord Denethor is Boromir's father.

I might have known!","Pippin.","Get up!","Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the King, steward.","Come!","All had turned to vain ambition. He would use even his grief as a cloak! A thousand years this city has stood and now at the whim of a madman it will fall! And the white tree, the tree of the King will never bloom again.","A wizard is never late! Frodo Baggins. Nor is he early, he arrives precisely when he means to.","You didn't think Id miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?","My lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir but it is not now. War is coming. The enemy is on your doorstep. As steward, you are charged with the defence of this city. Where are Gondor's armies? You still have friends. You are not alone in this fight. Send word to Theoden of Rohan. Light the beacons.","So how is the old rascal? I hear it is going to be a party of special significance?","Well that should please him.","What?","Into the Mines!","Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that Thorin gave him","Yes. I never told him, but its worth was greater than the value of The Shire!","I've no memory of this place","We now have but one choice, we must face the long dark of Moria. Be on your guard, there are older and fouler things than orcs in the deep places of the world","The wealth of Moria is not in gold, or jewels, but Mithril","Yes, there it lies. This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow.","This is not the weather of the world. This is a device of Sauron's making. A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host. The Orcs of Mordor have no love of daylight, so he covers the face of the sun to ease their passage along the road to war. When the shadow of Mordor reaches this city it will begin.","Oh, it's too late for that Peregrin. There's no leaving this city. Help must come to us.","They guard it because they have hope. A faint and fading hope that one day it will flower. That a king will come and this city will be as it once was before it fell into decay. The old wisdom born out of the west was forsaken. Kings made tombs more splendid than the houses of the living and counted the old names of their descent, dearer than the names of their sons. Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry or in high, cold towers asking questions of the stars. And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin. The line of Kings failed. The white tree withered. The rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men.","Good gracious me!","Indeed?","If you're referring to the incident with the dragon, I was barely involved. All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door.","Oh really?","It's Gollum","He's been following us for three days","Escaped, or was set loose and now the Ring has drawn him here, He won't ever be rid of his need for it. He hates and loves the Ring, as he hates and loves himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story, Yes, he was once called, before the Ring found him. Before it drove him mad","Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death and many that die, deserve life. Can you give it to them Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgement Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play, yet for good or ill.... before this is over. The pity of Bilbo, may rule the fate of many","So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, in which case you also were meant to have it and that is an encouraging thought. Oh! Its that way","So am I dear boy. So am I.","And what about very old friends?","Bilbo Baggins.","It's good to see you. One hundred and eleven years old who would believe it. You haven't aged a day!","Just tea, thank you.","Owwwh!","Gimli!","Here lies Balin, son of Fundin, Lord of Moria. He is dead then. Its as I feared.","They have taken the Bridge and the second hall. We have barred the gates, but cannot hold them for long. The ground shakes. Drums, Drums in the deep. We cannot get out. A shadow moves in the dark. We cannot get out. They are coming.","Let me risk a little more light, Behold the great realm and dwarf city of Dwarrowdelf.","No, but the air doesnt smell so foul down here. If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.","Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity!","Just tea, thank you.","Oh not at all!","So you mean to go through with your plan then?","You will tell him wont you?","No.","Frodo suspects something.","Fool of a Took!","Look at me.","Look at me! What did you see?","Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?","He's very fond of you.","What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?","There was no lie in Pippin's eyes. A fool but an honest fool he remains.","He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring. We've been strangely fortunate. Pippin saw in the Palantir a glimpse of the enemy's plan. Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith.","His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing. He knows the Heir of Elendil has come forth, Men are not as weak as he supposed. There is courage still. Strength enough, perhaps, to challenge him. Sauron fears this. He will not risk the peoples of Middle Earth uniting under one banner. He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground, before he sees a King return to the throne of men. If the beacons of Gondor are lit Rohan must be ready for war.","And what did you tell him? Speak!","No!","They will be. You must come to Minas Tirith by another road. Follow the river. Look to the black ships. Understand this, things are now in motion that cannot be undone. I ride for Minas Tirith, and I wont be going alone.","Of all the Hobbits, Peregrin Took, you are the worst! Hurry! Hurry!","Three days ride as the Nazg'l flies.
